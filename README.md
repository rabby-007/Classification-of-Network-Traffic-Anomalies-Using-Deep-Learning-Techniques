# Network Traffic Anomaly Detection Web App


This is a Streamlit web application for detecting anomalies in network traffic using a trained deep learning model (Autoencoder). The app allows users to input real-time traffic features (e.g., bytes, packets, ports) and receive a prediction indicating whether the traffic is **normal** or **anomalous**.
